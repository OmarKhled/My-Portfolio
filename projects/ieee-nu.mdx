#### Web stack and explanation

As it was intended to be mostly a static website, so, I went with nextjs as a framework and a static site generator. I choosed firestore as a database option for the website to hold the data of the forms and determined to have some 3d interactive elements on the website using [threejs](https://threejs.org). 

The design and the structure of the website considered the newest SEO patterns by using structured data to provide info about each page to the search engine scrappers.

The styling however was done using several global scss stylesheets that followed the UI Design I created earlier on Adobe XD, the design followed the structure of the other IEEE SBs websites to provide a good user experience and avoid confusion, nevertheless the new design introuduced new sections like the recruitment page that introduces those who are willing to volunteer with info about the SB and a form to sign up and a section about the SB's annual megaevent, the
[Egyptian Space Summit](https://ieenu.com/spacesummit) which gives an info about the event, the prizes, previous speakers, ...etc
