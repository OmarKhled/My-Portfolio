#### Problem Overview

[IEEE NU](https://ieeenu.com) is a student activity in Nile University - the university I'm currently studying in - and they needed a website that can represent them online and hold the forms for thier annual events like the [Egyptian Space Summit](https://ieeenu.com/spacesummit), they did have a solid React based website but that had neither good UI nor performane or seo and that didn't satisfy them.

</VideoPlayer>

They also planned on participating with this website in the [IEEE student branch website contest](https://students.ieee.org/student-opportunities/sac-awards-programs/ieee-student-branch-website-contest/) so, we had that in mind
