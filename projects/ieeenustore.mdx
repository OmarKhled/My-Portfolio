#### Project Overview

The [IEEE NU Online Store](https://store.ieeenu.com) is an e-commerce platform provided by the IEEE NU student activity at Nile University, catering to the needs of engineering students by providing them with the necessary hardware components and materials. As a developer assigned to the project, the main goal was to create a fast and clean UI that allows students to browse the product catalog and place orders quickly.

#### Project Development

With a tight deadline of one month, there was no time to build a backend from scratch. To ensure the timely delivery of the project, the focus was on the user experience. As a result, a headless commerce engine called [Commercejs](https://commercejs.com) was used to process orders and act as a database for products. User registration was also removed to reduce friction and speed up the ordering process.

Most of the development decisions were focused on the front-end side. Remix.js was chosen as the framework because it allowed for writing code on both the server and client sides in the same file, which saved time. Remix.js also renders pages server-side, which was ideal for product pages as they were not statically generated, saving storage space. The project was designed with the neubrutalism style to appeal to the youth's taste, and all the styles were written from scratch using styled components.
