      <Description>
        Iâ€™m a design-minded front-end engineer. My role is sometimes referred to
        as a front-end designer, UI developer, UI engineer, or a design
        engineer. I create a wide range of products for the web from browser
        extensions to CLI tools, emails, and more, not just websites! My focus
        is always on delivering engaging, user-friendly products that exceed
        expectations, while also placing a strong emphasis on writing clean and
        maintainable code.

        It&apos;s rare to find someone who knows something about everything and
        everything about something, which makes Omar an outstanding team player:
        He is a superlative web developer who always impressed me with meeting
        the deliverables days before the deadline with the requested quality and
        better. He can create designs, create content, shoot and edit videos,
        and handle projects.

      >
        When he works as a leader or team player, the imperative of success is
        not negotiable. Omar is a well-organized and talented person. He has
        demonstrated a destigmatized resilience in accepting constructive
        criticism and transforming it into gained skill and experience. In
        addition to that, he sticks to deadlines regardless of the workload. I
        worked with him for more than a year in different activities (voluntary,
        paid, and competitive), and he was always the best team player or leader
        I worked with.
